# Exam-Proctoring-System
The specialized Machine Learning Model based project to avoid cheating activities during online exams.

## Why we need this Exam Proctoring System ?
- To avoid cheating during examinations.
- To make examination process more transparent.
- To maintain the quality and reliabilty of education system.

## How it works ?
This Proctoring system takes access of the webcam of exam-attendar and monitor all his activities. If it feels that there is 
some inappropriate activities are taking place. Then it simply alert the Exam Proctor as well as gives the  
notice to the student and tell him to avoid all this inappropriate activities.

## To Do
- Clone the project from my repo.
- Please keep all the file and folder name as it is.
- Make sure that each and every module as well as ML model is persent or not.
- Due to large size I didn't upload `yolov3.weights` in `models` folder. You can simply download it from the following link of my drive. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KdMJ0E_vqqQNktY4YjMnwVZNkm3Q59tN/view?usp=sharing
  After download put this `yolov3.weights` in the `models` folder.

## Problems
- Some times the person and phone detector works with less accuracy.
- If you have any issue in installation jst call me on: +91 9096553454

## Desclaimer
- I copied some of the code which gives problem to me from `StackOverflow`.
